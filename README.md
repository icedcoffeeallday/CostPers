# CostPers
CostPers is an app that helps you better understand the value of your things. The app keeps track of how much you paid for an item and how many times you've used it - then it calculates the item's real-time "cost per use."

Watch this short demo video to see the CostPers app in action:

Costpers was created as a final project at Dev Bootcamp, San Francisco.

## MVP Functionality

* CostPers is an iOS and Android app built on a decoupled architecture featuring:
 * Rails API backend
 * React Native frontend

*Rails API backend features*
* User authentication with BCrypt
* Calculates CostPers
* Controls item sorting and starred/un-starred item lists
* Parses and passes JSON to the frontend

*React Native frontend features*
* Allows users to create and store items, as well as each item's uses, passing data to and from the backend via Axios
* Displays CostPer reduction in real-time when user logs a use of an item
* Routing and state management handled with React Native Router Flux

## Flow
* Log in to see a list of your items, with starred items shown at the top
* From the item list screen, you can:
 * Log a use of any item by tapping the gray checkmark, and see the cost-per-use go down in real time
 * Tap on any item to view the item's price and total uses, plus favorite or un-favorite the item
 * Use Add Item footer button to add an item

## Future Features
* You love logging seeing your laptop's CostPer drop, but what about all those subscriptions you have hanging around? Additional configuration for monthly subscriptions is on our list!
* Add item photos
* Deeper item categorization and analytics
* Log past uses for an item you already own
* Emoji support :heart:
* Notifications and Google Maps integration for donating items with high CostPers
